# Roguelike
An ambitious mod for Titanfall 2's campaign. You're welcome to contribute &amp; playtest - however this mod is far from finished and misses a lot of content.

# 0.3 BETA :D
*We also got patch notes. Because I hate myself :)*

The beta is here. Unpolished, Unclean, and probably as buggy as my room (thank you bedbugs).

But what's new? Come on down and read all of these patch notes :D

<br>

## **(NEW) Armor**

Armor is a brand new mechanic, which will slowly turn into Roguelike’s **main mechanic** as I continue working on it.

<br>

### *But wasn’t the entire idea of Roguelike stacking items until the game breaks?*
Yes. It was. But, as it turns out, that makes things confusing and (largely) unfun, unless you're me and know everything about the mod already.

### *But what *is* armor?*
Armor has *stats*, and *stats* give you benefits! From extra speed to cooldown reduction, every stat has something to give. But **beware**, as every armor piece has an.. *imbalance* in stat distribution. So choose one or two stats to spec into - and start raising those numbers.

<br>

## **General**

- Added "FUCKING NUTS" difficulty.
  
  *Don't ask. Don't choose it. Unless you want to. I ain't your mum.*

- When dying due to falls, you now revert to a checkpoint instead of having your run end. 

  *Dev Note: This makes certain speedrun strats, such as Barker Skip and River Jump much less punishing.*

- ### Into the Abyss returns!
  - Thought it'd never come back? WRONG. SUFFER.
  - Effect and Cause 1, and Beacon 1 are **still skipped.** 

- ### Health
  - Health Regen Rate reduced by 20% (Now 4HP/s)
  - Health Regen Rate now scales with level.

    *Dev Note: The intention of health regen, was to provide a way to regain health in the early game. With healing items remaining sparse, I think for now this should provide a good solution. Do note that the more health you get from non-level sources, the "slower" regen becomes.*

  - You now get 50% of the damage you deal as health.
  - You now get 33% of the damage you take as **Hard Damage.**
    
    **Hard Damage** temporarily caps your maximum health. It is gained over 5 seconds, after a 4 second delay.

    *Dev Note: this new system forces you to be aggressive to regain your health. Base health regen takes 20 seconds now - making it unviable to hide behind a corner to regain health.*

- ### Leveling
  - Now exponential, each level takes 5% more XP than the last.
  - Enemies now award 5% more XP (multiplicative) per level.

- ### BT-7274
  - Now gains 2 loadouts each level, instead of them being randomized each level.

<br>

## **Weapons**

- No longer lose ammo randomly when dropped from NPCs.

- Should now have the correct amount of ammo.

  *Dev Note: previously, guns such as Belt Fed spitfires, would only come with one mag worth of ammo. This should be fixed now(?)*

- Weapons with 4-7 mods are now significantly less common.

### **(NEW)** *Burst Orientation x3, x4 and Mag Dump*

With weird naming, these mods turn your pistols, explosives, assault rifles and shotguns into burst mode machines. They may increase fire rate or damage.

### EPG

* Stockpile Max 10 > 50
* Starting Stockpile 5 > 45

### Devotion
* *It Never Ends*
  - Sound fixed.
  - Max Fire Rate 95 > 165 (5,700RPM > 9,900RPM)
  - No longer uses a clip - now comes with 3,300 bullets and can collect up to 8,250.

### Mastiff
* Deploy Time 0.8s > 0.4s

### Pistols

* No longer give a 20% speed boost when equipped.

  *Dev Note: Made it weird and confusing. Even for me xD*

### Ordnance, with the exception of ticks

- Max Charges 4 > 2
- Now has a cooldown of ~15s (this means you can use the same grenade indefinitely)
